# Prompt Heist Godot Prototype

This is the first playable foundation for **Prompt Heist: Trust No One**, built for Godot 4 with GDScript.

## Run it

1. Install Godot 4.x.
2. Import `project.godot` from the Godot Project Manager.
3. Press **F6/F5** to run the project.
4. Add at least three players and select **Start heist**.

The current prototype supports local pass-and-play role reveals. With four or more players, exactly one player becomes the hidden Informant. Three-player matches run in cooperative mode.

## Current milestone

- Responsive 2D project shell
- Validated 3–6 player lobby
- Unique player names
- Deterministic game phases
- Random specialist-role assignment
- Optional hidden Informant
- Private pass-and-play role reveal
- First mission briefing

## Next milestone

Implement the planning round with three action cards, team voting, deterministic resolution, and suspicion/time/resource meters. After the local match is fun and testable, add real multiplayer rooms and server-side OpenAI calls.
